# So that jekyll-seo-tag doesn't include the ginormous description below in the
# page title. ðŸ˜±
tagline: My Home on the Internet

# I modified _includes/footer.html to treat the description as Markdown.
# However, it seems to normalize the whitespace first (or something), so it
# needs explicit line breaks.

  As you can see, there isn't much here, yet. I'll be adding more content as I
  create it. And yes, I know "Digital Den" is a *terrible* name. Hopefully, I'll
  come up with something better, soon.

  In the mean time, do you want to check out my poorly-maintained set of [user
  scripts](user-scripts/)? No? Okay, then.
